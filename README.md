## CROSSWORD SOLVER

#### Description
This is my entry as final project for the Course "_CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python_"
The scope of the program is to find all the possible answers for a Crossword when you knows only some of the letters for the world to be solved.
The possible answers will be searched in a list of words provided by [Brooke Husic](https://twitter.com/xandraladee) e [Enrique Henestroza Anguiano](https://(https://twitter.com/datalexic)) see [Spread the word (list)](https://www.spreadthewordlist.com/)
